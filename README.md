E COMMERCE ANDROID APPLICATION

This repo contains the code of an android application which is used for purchasing products online.
It contains a signin/signup feature using Firebase.
Everything in this application including images of the product, address of users etc. are fetched and stored through Firebase.
This makes the app extremely light weight.

Following are the Youtube links demonstrating the working after I successfully made this application -
